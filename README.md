MediaTek Based GSM Tracker
==========================

This project is a collection of documentation and tools from research into a Chinese GSM device.

The goal was to find an inexpensive off the shelf minature GSM unit that could be repurposed for other projects. Typical GSM development kits are relatively large and expensive in comparison.
